This project has 4 objectives

1 - Utilise Kafka to ingest mainframe based cobol copybook defined records

2 - Use MQSeries connectors (link here)

3 - Use Legstar cobol/Avro libs (link here) to transform those records into avro format

4 - Potentially (??) host the transformations as AWS lambda functions

5 - Examine how we can reduce the latency of all of the above to provide a near as possible real time experience
